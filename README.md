# Mythic-Lamprey
A basic Python3 Mythic agent using the HTTP C2 profile.  Very extendible
## Usage:
1) Put the lamprey folder into your `Mythic/Payload_Types` folder
2) Run `mythic-cli payload add lamprey` to add it to Mythic
3) Use the payload

## Notes:
- Lamprey only supports http, not https
- Lamprey does not support encryption
